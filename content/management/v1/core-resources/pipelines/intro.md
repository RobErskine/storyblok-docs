With Storyblok’s Pipelines, stages define a strict content staging workflow in your space. This is crucial if you want to create a reliable production environment. You can define multiple stages, each with its own API access token for your content, to preview and test before it goes live.

Don’t confuse the Pipeline stages with Git Branches functionality. This is a very misleading comparison!
