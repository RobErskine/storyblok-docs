title: Branch deployments
---

The endpoint /v1/spaces/:space_id/deployments can be used to deploy branches.

You can read more about branches [here](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/setup-branches-and-releases#pipeline-stage).

It's important to note that stories created via the Management API would be created in the default branch. However, using additional parameters, the content can be published to specific branches (or pipeline stages, as they referred to them).
